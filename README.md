# TDoA - Time difference of arrival

## Inputs:

1. wav files with GNSS timestamps from KiwiSDRs which are generated by [kiwiclient](https://github.com/jks-prv/kiwiclient/tree/jks-v0.1)
2. positions of the used KiwiSDRs. This information is stored in the directory `gnss_pos` and put there by `kiwirecorder.py`

## Prerequisites
* This code should work on linux and on OSX
* Install octave (>=4.2.2) + signal package: in octave: `pkg install -forge signal`

## Download / Installation
* Initial checkout: `git clone --recursive  https://github.com/hcab14/TDoA.git`
* Update to latest master branch: `git pull --recurse-submodules`
* For now everything is contained in the git repository, i.e., nothing is installed in /usr etc.

## Running the example octave script
* in octave: `[tdoa,input]=proc_tdoa_DCF77;`
* this should produce two files in the `png` subdirectory
